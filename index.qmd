I am a Doctoral Candidate in the Department of Epidemiology at Emory Universityâ€™s Rollins School of Public Health. My research is focused on infectious disease epidemiology, particularly HIV and tuberculosis epidemiology, and applications of causal inference. I have a background in public health and medical anthropology, with specific training and expertise in epidemiological research design; statistical, geospatial, and qualitative analysis; and cognitive assessment/scale development. I have experience in HIV/AIDS and TB prevention and treatment, causal inference methods, and the application of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial statistics to public health.
